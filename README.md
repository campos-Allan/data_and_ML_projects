## [Random Forest Application in Public Transportation Database](https://github.com/campos-Allan/random_forests_in_belo_horizonte)
I did this project as my undergraduate thesis to get a bachelor's degree. This project consists in the application of a myriad of random forests regressor models, varying in the hyperparameters of 'max_depth' and 'n_estimators', with the objective to analyze its capacity to predict the number of passengers per bus line per day in a certain time of the year, with a certain set of weather conditions.

## [Customer Analysis for Marketing](https://github.com/campos-Allan/marketing_project)
This project analyzes customer data to prioritize marketing efforts based on churn probability, purchase value, and engagement (purchase frequency). Using a simulated dataset, it calculates a marketing score by normalizing and weighting these metrics (40% purchase value, 40% frequency, 20% inverse churn probability).
