# Index of Data Science and Machine Learning projects
## [Random Forest Application in Public Transportation Database](https://github.com/campos-Allan/random_forests_in_belo_horizonte)
I did this project as my undergraduate thesis to get a bachelor's degree. This project consists in the application of a myriad of random forests regressor models, varying in the hyperparameters of 'max_depth' and 'n_estimators', with the objective to analyze its capacity to predict the number of passengers per bus line per day in a certain time of the year, with a certain set of weather conditions.

**Tools used:** Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## [Podcast Radar](https://github.com/campos-Allan/podcast_radar)
I did this project to answer the question, 'Are podcasts in Brazil losing their hype?' and to use YouTube's API. To accomplish this, I analyzed the number of views, likes, comments, video duration, title, and publication date of every video from the top 3 biggest podcasts in Brazil. The analysis mainly focused on generating graphics of these metrics over time, looking at statistical trends, and drawing regression lines.

**Tools used:** Youtube API, Pandas, Numpy and Seaborn.

## [Studios Flow Analysis](https://github.com/campos-Allan/flow_analysis)
This project was born from data I collected using YouTube's API in the last project. The biggest podcast in Brazil, Studios Flow, was actually a studio with several podcasts. In this project, I analyzed which program from this company had the best engagement metrics and then tried to predict this engagement with Machine Learning using features such as: publication date, the program the podcast belonged to, and video duration. I built the first model with Random Forests and then with Neural Networks, but the models failed to make accurate predictions, as the features proved to be insufficient for making such predictions.

**Tools used:** Youtube API, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Numpy and Seaborn.
